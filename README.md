# TransitPulse

A Bay Area transit analytics platform: BART and Bay Wheels ridership pipelines (Dagster + PySpark + dbt on BigQuery),
station forecasts, a causal study of the eBART extension, an AI analyst agent that answers questions with SQL, and a
responsive website with a live map of scheduled BART trains.

> **Status:** in development. See [`docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`](docs/CURRENT_STATE.md) for what works today.

## Run locally

Requires Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). On Windows there is no `make`; use `uv run python tasks.py <task>`.

```sh
uv sync                                  # install
uv run python tasks.py api               # site + API on http://localhost:8000 (map data is committed)
uv run python tasks.py test              # Python + browser-maths unit tests
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium && npx playwright test   # browser tests
```

Data pipeline, fully local (no cloud account needed; Spark runs in Docker on Windows):

```sh
uv sync --group pipeline --group dbt --group spark
uv run python tasks.py dagster           # Dagster UI on http://localhost:3000: materialize assets / backfill years
# or step by step:
uv run python tasks.py web-data          # GTFS -> web/data/*.json
uv run python tasks.py stations          # GTFS -> station list for the SCD2 snapshot
uv run python tasks.py spark             # data/raw/bart_od/*.csv.gz -> partitioned Parquet
uv run python tasks.py dbt               # dbt build on DuckDB (data/transitpulse.duckdb)
```
